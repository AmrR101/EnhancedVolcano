#' EnhancedVolcano: Publication-ready volcano plots with enhanced colouring and labeling.
#'
#' Volcano plots represent a useful way to visualise the results
#' of differential expression analyses. Here, we present a highly-configurable
#' function that produces publication-ready volcano plots. EnhancedVolcano
#' will attempt to fit as many transcript names in the plot window as possible,
#' thus avoiding 'clogging' up the plot with labels that could not otherwise
#' have been read.
